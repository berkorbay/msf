# A model selection framework for better option pricing

This repository will (hopefully) contain documentation and codes about my PhD thesis work. 

## Short description about the work

The idea is simple. There are many models to put a price on an option contract. The problem with the pricing  models is they fail to sustain high performance in a rapidly changing environment such as financial markets, even with frequent parameter updates. 

We propose a selection method to pick price estimates from different models so properly that the model selection's pickings result in higher performance than any individual model in its model set.

Once a proper model set is determined, model selection can work with minimal tweaking across different time periods, assets and performance metrics.

## TODO

- Including proper documentation and a less academic version of the model selection method.
- Adding understandable comments on model selection codes.
- An `R` package.
